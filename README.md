# cows drinking system
 This program for a water refill system
This Python program simulates the process of cows drinking water from a tub and the automatic refilling of the tub.

Getting Input: The program starts by asking how many cows are drinking and how many liters each cow will drink.

Setting Values: It sets various constant values, such as the drinking rate per cow and the size of the tub.

Drinking Process: The program continuously checks the water level in the tub. If the cows start drinking, the water level decreases based on the number of cows and their drinking rate.

Refilling the Tub: If the water level gets too low, the program turns on a pump to refill the tub.

Recording Data: It prints out the current water level and the amount of water drunk by the cows at regular intervals.

Stopping the Process: Once the cows have drunk the desired amount of water, the program stops the drinking process and ensures the tub is refilled to its original size.

This program helps to automate and monitor the process of cows drinking water and ensures that the water supply is maintained.
